/// actix-web uses a *type-map* to represent its application state: a `HashMap` that stores arbitrary
/// data (using the `Any` type) against their unique type identifier(obtained via `TypeId::of`).
/// `web::Data`, when a new request comes in, computes the `TypeId` of the type you specified in the
/// signature (in this case `PgConnection`) and checks if there is a record corresponding to it in the
/// type-map. If there is one, it casts the retrieved `Any` value to the type you specified(`TypeId`
/// is unique, nothing to worry about) and passes it to your handler.
///
/// It is an interesting technique to perform what in other language ecosystems might be referred to
/// as *dependency injection*.
///
/// # Cleaning up Instrumentation Code - tracing::Instrument
///
/// We'd like all operations within subscribe to happen within the context of request_span. In other
/// words, we'd like to *wrap* the `subscribe` function in a span. `#[tracing::instrument]` creates
/// a span at the beginning of the function invocation and automatically attaches all arguments passed
/// to the function to the context of the span - in our case, `form` and `pool`. Often function arguments
/// won't be displayable on log records (e.g. `pool`) or we'd like to specify more explicitly what
/// should/how they should be captured (e.g. naming each field of `form`) - we can explicitly tell
/// `tracing` to ignore them using the skip directive.
///
/// `name` can be used to specify the message associated to the function span - if omitted, it defaults
/// to the function name.
///
/// We can also enrich the span's context using the `fields` directive. It leverages the same syntax
/// we have already for the info_span! macro.
///
/// The result is quite nice: all instrumentation concerns are visually separated by execution
/// concerns - the first are dealt with in a procedural macro that "decorates" the function declaration,
/// while the function body focuses on the actual business logic.
