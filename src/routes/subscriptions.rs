/// `web::Data`, when a new request comes in, computes the `TypeId` of the type you specified in the
/// signature (in this case `PgConnection`) and checks if there is a record corresponding to it in the
/// type-map. If there is one, it casts the retrieved `Any` value to the type you specified(`TypeId`
/// is unique, nothing to worry about) and passes it to your handler.

/// # Cleaning up Instrumentation Code - tracing::Instrument
///
/// We'd like all operations within subscribe to happen within the context of request_span. In other
/// words, we'd like to *wrap* the `subscribe` function in a span. `#[tracing::instrument]` creates
/// a span at the beginning of the function invocation and automatically attaches all arguments passed
/// to the function to the context of the span - in our case, `form` and `pool`. Often function arguments
/// won't be displayable on log records (e.g. `pool`) or we'd like to specify more explicitly what
/// should/how they should be captured (e.g. naming each field of `form`) - we can explicitly tell
/// `tracing` to ignore them using the skip directive.
///
/// `name` can be used to specify the message associated to the function span - if omitted, it defaults
/// to the function name.
///
/// We can also enrich the span's context using the `fields` directive. It leverages the same syntax
/// we have already for the info_span! macro.
///
/// The result is quite nice: all instrumentation concerns are visually separated by execution
/// concerns - the first are dealt with in a procedural macro that "decorates" the function declaration,
/// while the function body focuses on the actual business logic.

/// # Database Transcations
/// Our `POST /subscriptions` handler has grown in complexity - we are now performing two `INSERT`
/// queries against our Postgres database: one to store the details of the new subscriber, one to
/// store the newly generated subscription token.
///
/// What happens if the application crashes between those two operations?
///
/// There are three possible states for our database after an invocation of `POST /subscriptions`:
/// * a new subscriber and its token have been persisted;
/// * a new subscriber has been persisted, without a token;
/// * nothing has been persisted.
///
/// The more queries you have, the worse it gets to reason about the possible end states of our database.
///
/// Relational databases (and a few others) provide a mechanism to mitigate this issue: **transations**.
///
/// Transactions are a way to group together related operations in a single **unit of work**.
///
/// The database guarantees that all operations within a transaction will succeed or fail together:
/// the database will never be left in a state where the effect of only a subset of the queries in a
/// transaction is visible. If any of the queries within a transaction fails the database **rolls back**:
/// all changes performed by previous queries are reverted, the operation is aborted.
/// You can also explicitly trigger a rollback with the `ROLLBACK` statement.
///
/// Transactions are a deep topic: they not only provide a way to convert multiple statements into an
/// all-or-nothing operation, they also hide the effect of uncommitted changes from other queries that
/// might be running, concurrently, against the same tables.
